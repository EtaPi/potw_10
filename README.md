As I said, there's gonna be cake. And it's only sort of a lie!

By breaking the cipher, you discovered a set of instructions that would hopefully help you escape from the Grue once and for all. But alas, not today. After following the instructions, you happen upon the Mainframe. And by mainframe, I mean mainframe: that archaic machine with very limited resources.

You conjecture that this Mainframe is powering the mazes and the Grue, and you know the Grue is hungry... maybe if you give him some cake he'll let you go.

Your task is to write a program that accepts an integer as input and outputs a cake with that many candles. For example, Here's a cake with one candle:

```
 $ 
 |
===
~~~
---
```

and here's one with three:

```
 $ $ $
 | | |
=======
~~~~~~~
-------
```

If you're given a zero, output this message:

```
Congrats on the new baby!
```

And if you're given a negative number, output this boring cake with no candles :(

```
===
~~~
---
```

But here's the catch. You have to write this program on the Mainframe. Limited resources, remember? Whoever's program takes up the fewest bytes is the winner.
